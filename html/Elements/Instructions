  This site tracks bugs in every distribution released through
  <a href="http://cpan.org">CPAN</a>.  All bug reports are
  publicly visible on this site. If a distribution tracks it's bugs elsewhere, that will also be noted on the pages for that distribution here.
</p>

<h3>Want to...</h3>

<h3>... find a distribution and browse its bugs?</h3>

  for distributions</a> by name or author.  When you've found the
  distribution you're looking for, you can browse known bugs and
  report new bugs.
</p>

<h3>... report a bug in a module using web-interface?</h3>

<h3>... report a bug in a module using email?</h3>
<p>
  To submit a bug report for a given distribution by email, send mail
  to <strong>bug-&lt;distribution-name&gt;@rt.cpan.org</strong>, where
  "&lt;distribution-name&gt;" is something like DBIx-SearchBuilder or
  Class-DBI or Acme-Current-Forever. Use
  <a href="<% RT->Config->Get("WebPath") %>/Public/">search</a> to find name of

<h3>... reply to an existing bug via email?</h3>

  following somewhere in the Subject: <strong>[rt.cpan.org #<em>NNNNN</em>]</strong>.

<h3>... report a bug in perl itself?</h3>
<p>
  To report bugs in perl itself, you're best off using the command-line
  'perlbug' tool or going to the <a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>.
</p>

<h3>... manage bugs in your distributions?</h3>
<p>
  To work with bugs, every module author with a
  <a href="http://pause.perl.org">PAUSE</a> account can log into
  rt.cpan.org with their PAUSE userid and password. If you can't log in or
  distributions you maintain aren't listed, you can send email to
  rt-cpan-admin@bestpractical.com.
