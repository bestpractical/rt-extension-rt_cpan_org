    <p>
      This site tracks bugs in every distribution released through
      <a href="http://cpan.org">CPAN</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Want to...</h2>

    <h2>... find a distribution and browse its bugs?</h2>
    <p>
      This site lets you <a href="<% $RT::WebBaseURL %>/Public/">search
      for distributions</a> by name or author.  When you've found the
      distribution you're looking for, you can browse known bugs and
      report new bugs.
    </p>

    <h2>... report a bug in a module using web-interface?</h2>
    <p>
      Use <a href="https://www.bitcard.org/">Bitcard</a> or OpenID account.
      Module authors can use PAUSE credentials.
    </p>

    <h2>... report a bug in a module using email?</h2>
    <p>
      To submit a bug report for a given distribution by email, send mail
      to <strong>bug-&lt;distribution-name&gt;@rt.cpan.org</strong>, where
      "&lt;distribution-name&gt;" is something like DBIx-SearchBuilder or
      Class-DBI or Acme-Current-Forever. Use
      <a href="<% $RT::WebBaseURL %>/Public/">search</a> to find name of
      a distribution.
    </p>

    <h2>... report a bug in perl itself?</h2>
    <p>
      To report bugs in perl itself, you're best off using the command-line
      'perlbug' tool or <a href="http://rt.perl.org">rt.perl.org.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>... manage bugs in your distributions?</h2>
    <p>
      To work with bugs, every module author with a
      <a href="http://pause.perl.org">PAUSE</a> account can log into
      rt.cpan.org with their PAUSE userid and password. If you can't log in or
      distributions you maintain aren't listed, please write to
      rt-cpan-admin@bestpractical.com at your earliest convenience.
    </p>

    <h2>... know more about this service?</h2>
    <p>
      Read <a href="<% $RT::WebBaseURL %>/Public/RT/CPAN/About.html">this document</a>.
