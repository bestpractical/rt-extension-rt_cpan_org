    <h2>What is this all about?</h2>
    <p>
      This site tracks bugs in every distribution released through
      <a href="http://cpan.org">CPAN</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Quick usage guidelines you can find on <a href="<% $RT::WebPath %>/">the main page</a></p>

    <h2>Recommendations (soft rules)</h2>
    <h3>For reporters</h3>

    <h4>Be polite</h4>

    <h4>Are maintainers required to act on all bugs reported by end users?</h4>
    <p>No. They are not. Unless you have an outside contractural relationship with
    a maintainer, you need to assume that they are a volunteer. Telling them they
    "must" do something is impolite and counterproductive.</p>
    
    <h4>Should maintainers accept bug reports against older versions of a module?</h4>
    <p>In general, we discourage bug reports against older versions of modules other
    than for historical reporting purposes (ie close immediately upon report with a
    note that it's been tested and found to work in the current version.)</p>
    <p>If a bug exists in the current CPAN version of a module, please do report the bug.</p>
    
    <h3>For authors and maintainers</h3>

    <h4>Be polite</h4>

    <h4>Can a module has own bug tracker?</h4>
    <p>Sure it can, but queue wouldn't be disabled and users still would be
    able to create tickets on rt.cpan.org.</p>

    <h2>What is used to power this service?</h2>
    <p>All parts used to build this service are open source software.
    The core is the <a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/">Request Tracker</a> project
    from Best Practical Solutions company. Everything else is either extension for this
    project or module from the CPAN.</p>

    <p>rt.cpan.org has some customizations which tie it to particular RT version, at this
    moment (2009-12) it's RT 3.8.HEAD.</p>

    <p>You can start from checking out from the repository:<br />
    <pre>    svn co svn://svn.bestpractical.com/RT-Extension-rt_cpan_org</pre><br />
    Or explore the source code via UI at
    <a href="http://svn.bestpractical.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi/bps/browse/RT-Extension-rt_cpan_org">RT-Extension-rt_cpan_org</a>.
    There is <a href="http://svn.bestpractical.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi/bps/view/RT-Extension-rt_cpan_org/bin/pull-live">a script in the bin directory</a>
    of the extension that installs everything.</p>
